This PDF is a preprint to Collision Avoidance in Mobile Robots using Dynamic Vortex Potential Fields.

In this paper, the collision avoidance problem for non-holonomic robots moving at constant linear
speeds in the 2-D plane is considered. The maneuvers to avoid collisions are designed using dynamic
vortex potential fields (PFs) and their negative gradients; this formulation leads to a reciprocal
behaviour between the robots, denoted as being cooperative. The repulsive field is selected as a
function of the velocity and position of a robot relative to another and introducing vorticity in its
definition guarantees the absence of local minima. Such a repulsive field is activated by a robot only
when it is on a collision path with other mobile robots or stationary obstacles. By analysing the
kinematics-based engagement dynamics in polar coordinates, it is shown that a cooperative robot is
able to avoid collisions with non-cooperating robots, such as stationary and constant velocity robots,
as well as those actively seeking to collide with it. Conditions on the PF parameters are identified that
ensure collision avoidance for all cases. Experimental results acquired using a mobile robot platform
support the theoretical contributions.
